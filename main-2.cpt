A plot equivalent to AstroML Fig 5.7 and 5.8 for lightcurve measurement points ($x_{i}, e_{i}$) for an object 217720894888346446 (without any averaging, raw forced photometry flux measurements). The solid lines show marginalized posterior pdfs for $\mu$ (left) and $\sigma$ (middle). The dashed histograms show the distributions of approximate estimates for $\mu$ and $\sigma$, for 10,000 bootstrap resamples of the same data set. The right panel shows the logarithm of the posterior probability density function for $\mu$ and $\sigma$.   ^^E^^L
