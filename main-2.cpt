A plot showing NCSA sources detected in coadds, removing the outliers beyond the edges of the plot. The coloring corresponds to the \verb|extendedness | parameter calculated in the pipeline based on the iPsfMag-iModelMag : red being 0 (compact), and green being 1 (extended). As iModelMag increases, the separation becomes less certain, as more distant galaxies are more compact.  ^^E^^L
