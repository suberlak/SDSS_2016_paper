Two-step approach to finding $\mu$ and $\sigma$ via $\mu_{0}$ and $\sigma_{0}$ for an object 217720894888346446. In this calculation we use raw psf flux, before employing the faint source treatment outlined in Section~\ref{sec:faint_sources}. On the left and middle panels,  solid lines trace marginalized posterior pdfs for $\mu$ and $\sigma$ , while dashed lines depict histogram distributions of 10,000 bootstrap resamples for $\mu_{0}$ and $\sigma_{0}$. The right panel shows the logarithm of the posterior probability density function for $\mu$ and $\sigma$.^^E^^L
