A color-magnitude plot , reproducing the results of Sesar+2010 , Fig.23 .  We show here only NCSA-processed sources, which is why certain RA ranges are omitted or have less sources. We only select sources with \verb|extendedness=0| parameter (stars).  The scale is showing the $\log_{10}$ of count. All sources have their  colors corrected for extinction. On first two panels the features of Sagittarius Stream are clearly visible. ^^E^^L
